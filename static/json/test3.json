She reports that yesterday she increased her home oxygen\n   from 2.5 L to 4 L secondary to some shortness of breath. She also\n   missed her daily dose of amiodarone 200 mg, and was told to skip her\n   metoprolol dose due to a low blood pressure when the home nurse visited\n   her yesterday. She noted the shortness of breath last night, especially\n   when she got up and went to the bathroom. Towards the early hours of\n   the morning, she became more short of breath laying in bed. She was\n   very concerned about this and called EMS. She also noted a band-like\n   discomfort around her chest--very dissimilar to her prior myocardial\n   infarctions that were a different pain that radiated to her jaw. The\n   discomfort was not worse with inspiration. She has had no fevers. She\n   has a chronic cough with production of clear sputum. No sick contacts,\n   weight gain, leg swelling, or calf pain. No vomiting, diarrhea, or\n   bleeding. She does have nausea at baseline. No rashes or new bruises.\n   No abdominal pain.\n   .\n   Her initial vital signs were a temperature of 97.0, blood pressure of\n   110/59, heart rate of 132, respiratory rate of 20, and 91% on room air.\n   She was given 2 mg of morphine, 4 mg of zofran, 150 mg bolus of\n   amiodarone IV, 200 mg of PO amiodarone, 5 mg of roxicet, 325 mg of\n   tylenol, amiodarone drip, fentanyl 50 mcg, and 750 mg of levofloxacin.\n   In the ED, she was initially tachycardic with a heart rate as high as\n   140, but this converted to sinus at a rate of 70 after administration\n   of amiodarone. There was concern for worsening metastatic disease or\n   PE, so she underwent a chest CT. It was negative for a pulmonary\n   embolism, however it did demonstrate a worsening multifocal pneumonia\n   and worsening metastatic disease as compared to PET/CT from [**2143-1-21**].\n   During the time in the ED, her systolic blood pressure ranged from\n   70-90's. She was given one liter of IVF.

CT also demonstrated multi-focal\n   pneumonia, though she has had little clinical symptoms to suggest this;\n   a post-obstructive pneumonia is certainly possible as well, which could\n   remain more clinically asymptomatic. Her worsening underlying lung\n   malignancy also could account for some degree of her dyspnea, but would\n   not expect this to be so acute unless she had collapse or plugging. A\n   primary cardiac event is also possible. PE in setting of malignancy is\n   a possibility, but ruled out by CTA. CXR negative for pneumothorax.\n   Heart failure is also a possibility, however she does not have any\n   significant edema.\n   - Trend lactate, VBG\n   - Cycle cardiac enzymes\n   - Repeat EKG now\n   - Patient already received levofloxacin for pneumonia in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**]\n   discuss further broadening coverage, however no fever, leukocytosis, or\n   sputum production (though she is on steroids chronically)\n   - Follow up blood, sputum cultures\n   - Nebulizer treatments if helpful (though will avoid albuterol until\n   stable heart rate for a few more hours)\n   - Checking BNP given history of orthopnea, however suspect this was\n   more likely due to AF with RVR\n   - Consider repeat transthoracic echocardiogram should her hypoxia and\n   dyspnea not improve with above measures\n   .\n   #) Hypotension: Differential includes secondary to poor forward flow\n   from rapid ventricular response to AF, sepsis from infection, adrenal\n   insufficiency, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose, and\n   poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Other less likely possibilities\n   include cardiac event, pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT\n   (though no pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).\n   - IVF resuscitation until lactate normalizes, following urine output\n   - Checking random cortisol, initiating stress dose steroids given\n   chronic steroid use and recent taper from higher doses\n   - Consider expansion of antibiotic coverage, however currently does not\n   appear septic\n   - Continue PO amiodarone to improve HR control\n   - Cycle cardiac enzymes, though suspect she may have bump in troponin\n   given demand of RVR\n   - Sending urine, blood cultures, sputum if able (although already\n   received antibiotics in ED prior to any cultures being obtained)\n   .\n   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has\n   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone. She\n   reported not taking her amiodarone or metoprolol in the setting of not\n   feeling well for the last two days. Currently her rate is appropriately\n   controlled after receiving amiodarone bolus and PO home dose.\n   - Continue home amiodarone, holding metoprolol given hypotension\n   - Patient is not currently anticoagulated. She reports she had a 12\n   unit GIB in the past due to diverticulosis, so anti-coagulation has\n   been held since that time.\n   .\n   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]\n   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on\n   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded\n   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with\n   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further\n   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note\n   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line\n   chemotherapy.\n   - Will alert oncology of patient's admission, appreciate any\n   recommendations or assistance with management.\n   .\n   #) Anemia: Patient's anemia appears to be at her baseline (last HCT of\n   35.2 appears to be abherration from others in system which are 24-27).\n   Should she have symptoms of ischemia, would consider transfusion to\n   assist with volume repletion.\n   - Send type and cross, consider transfusion should she continue to need\n   volume and/or become symptomatic.\n   .\n   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last\n   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than\n   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.\n   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications\n   .\n   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Continue steroid therapy (just completed\n   taper down to home dose of 10 mg prednisone daily), however suspect she\n   would benefit from stress dosing for her acute illness, given that she\n   had been on higher doses with her history of being on steroids for her\n   cerebral edema on a longer term basis.\n   - Stress dose steroids\n   .\n   #) Coronary artery disease: EKG\n   - Will cycle enzymes\n   - Continue home aspirin, holding home BP medications ([**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan)\n   given hypotension, has allergy to statins.\n   - Repeat EKG\n   .\n   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.\n   .\n   #) FEN: Once respiratory status more stable, cardiac diet.

Her worsening underlying lung malignancy also\n   could account for some degree of her dyspnea, but would not expect this\n   to be so acute unless she had collapse or plugging. A primary cardiac\n   event is also possible. PE in setting of malignancy is a possibility,\n   but ruled out by CTA. CXR negative for pneumothorax. Could also have\n   exacerbation of COPD.\n   - Trend lactate, VBG (7.37, 50, 20), Follow up blood, sputum cultures\n   - Continue levofloxacin given low risk for HAP and clinically no fever,\n   leukocytosis, or sputum production (though she is on steroids\n   chronically)\n   - Nebulizer treatments if helpful for COPD component\n can hold in\n   setting of afib. Continue PO steroids.\n   - Checking BNP 3075 without prior for comparison. Would consider gentle\n   diuresis today as BP allows to reverse componenet of flash pulmonary\n   edema.\n   - Cardiac enzymes neg, TropT peaked at 0.03 on admission.\n   - EKG unchanged from baseline once in NSR\n   - Given lack of improvement and persisent dependence on non-rebreather,\n   will discuss checking TTE for new WMA, valvular defects or strain.\n   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.\n   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow\n   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,\n   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Questionable contribution of\n   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency\n as afebrile, no\n   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.\n   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG\n   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no\n   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).\n   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume\n   - Does not need stress dose steroids\n   - Does not appear to be septic\n   - Continue PO amiodarone although reverted back into afib at rates in\n   120s.\n   - f/u pancultures\n   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has\n   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although\n   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.\n   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, but now is again in Afib RVR,\n   asymptomatic, unchanged O2 requirement.\n   - Continue home amiodarone\n   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control\n   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.\n   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.\n   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without\n   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be\n   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib\n   fracture seen on CXR.\n   - Hydromorphone at home dose\n   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]\n   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on\n   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded\n   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with\n   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further\n   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note\n   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line\n   chemotherapy.\n   - Will alert oncology of patient's admission, appreciate any\n   recommendations or assistance with management.\n   - Will likely involve IP and consider bronchoscopy and palliative\n   stenting, if appropriate, to help with possible post-obstructive\n   pneumonia\n however unclear if  opening obstruction in one area will be\n   sufficient change to improve her resp status.\n   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3\n   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and\n   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.\n   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)\n   - Type and cross active\n   - Consider slow transfusion (EF 50%, likely worse with tachycardia),\n   although not convinced that pt requires volume.\n   - Guaiac stools\n   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last\n   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than\n   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.\n   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications\n   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Continue steroid taper per outpt regimen. No\n   signs of adrenal insufficiency\n   #) Coronary artery disease: Ces neg, EKG unchanged.\n   - Continue home aspirin, restarted BB\n   - holding home [**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan, not on statin due to allergy.\n   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition: PO cardiac diet as tolerated\n   Glycemic Control: None\n   Lines: PIV x 2\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT: : Heparin SQ TID\n   Stress ulcer: Not on PPI at home, though should be while on high dose\n   steroids\n   Communication:  [**Doctor First Name 3582**], daughter # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8557**] (She states her husband\n   does not answer the phone regularly)\n   Code status:  DNR/DNI.

She also\n   missed her daily dose of amiodarone 200 mg, and was told to skip her\n   metoprolol dose due to a low blood pressure when the home nurse visited\n   her yesterday. She noted the shortness of breath last night, especially\n   when she got up and went to the bathroom. Towards the early hours of\n   the morning, she became more short of breath laying in bed. She was\n   very concerned about this and called EMS.

For now continue amio and start high dose PO\n   steroids, up from current dose of 10mg for PMR\n   - will consult cardiology regarding other potential afib therapy given\n   previous difficulty with rate control.\n   - Although very low likelihood of infectious etiology, will f/u\n   cultures, continue levoflox.\n   - COPD exacerbation unlikely so nebs not necessary. Will be getting PO\n   steroids anyway.\n   - Goal sats 90-94%.\n   - Will hold off diuresis today as congestion will likely improve with\n   or without diuresis with improved HR.\n   - Will check TTE today for new WMA, valvular defects or strain.\n   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.\n   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow\n   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,\n   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Unlikely contribution of\n   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency\n as afebrile, no\n   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.\n   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG\n   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no\n   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).\n   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume\n   - Does not need stress dose steroids but will be getting increased dose\n   for ? amiodarone toxicity\n   - Does not appear to be septic\n   - Continue PO amiodarone until confirm or rule out toxicity and\n   cardiology input re alternative rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].\n   - f/u pancultures\n   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has\n   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although\n   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.  Also\n   likely component of hypoxia inducing afib given worsening lung disease.\n   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, with short reversion to Afib rate\n   in 120s with other VSS.\n   - Continue home amiodarone\n   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control\n   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.\n   - cardiology consult re potential alternative therapy if amiodarone\n   toxicity confirmed.\n   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.\n   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without\n   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be\n   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib\n   fracture seen on CXR.\n   - Hydromorphone at home dose\n   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]\n   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on\n   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded\n   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with\n   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further\n   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note\n   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line\n   chemotherapy.\n   - discuss long term plan with oncology\n   - palliative care and social work consults\n   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3\n   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and\n   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.\n   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)\n   - Type and cross active\n   - Consider slow transfusion (EF 50%, likely worse with tachycardia),\n   although not convinced that pt requires volume.\n   - Guaiac stools\n   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last\n   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than\n   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.\n   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications\n   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Will be on increased steroids for ? amio\n   toxicity.\n   #) Coronary artery disease: CE\ns neg, EKG unchanged.\n   - Continue home aspirin, restarted BB\n   - holding home [**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan, not on statin due to allergy.\n   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition: PO cardiac diet as tolerated\n   Glycemic Control: None\n   Lines: PIV x 2\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT: : Heparin SQ TID\n   Stress ulcer: Not on PPI at home, though should be while on high dose\n   steroids\n   Communication:  [**Doctor First Name 3582**], daughter # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8557**] (She states her husband\n   does not answer the phone regularly)\n   Code status:  DNR/DNI.

She reports that yesterday she increased her home oxygen\n   from 2.5 L to 4 L secondary to some shortness of breath. She also\n   missed her daily dose of amiodarone 200 mg, and was told to skip her\n   metoprolol dose due to a low blood pressure when the home nurse visited\n   her yesterday. She noted the shortness of breath last night, especially\n   when she got up and went to the bathroom. Towards the early hours of\n   the morning, she became more short of breath laying in bed. She was\n   very concerned about this and called EMS. She also noted a band-like\n   discomfort around her chest--very dissimilar to her prior myocardial\n   infarctions that were a different pain that radiated to her jaw. The\n   discomfort was not worse with inspiration. She has had no fevers. She\n   has a chronic cough with production of clear sputum. No sick contacts,\n   weight gain, leg swelling, or calf pain. No vomiting, diarrhea, or\n   bleeding. She does have nausea at baseline.

The preliminary report demonstrated multi-focal pneumonia,\n   though she has had little clinical symptoms to suggest this; a\n   post-obstructive pneumonia is certainly possible as well, which could\n   remain more clinically asymptomatic. Her worsening underlying lung\n   malignancy also could account for some degree of her dyspnea, but would\n   not expect this to be so acute unless she had collapse or plugging. A\n   primary cardiac event is also possible. PE in setting of malignancy is\n   a possibility, but ruled out by CTA. CXR negative for pneumothorax.\n   Heart failure is also a possibility, however she does not have any\n   significant edema. Could also have exacerbation of COPD.\n   - Trend lactate, VBG\n   - Cycle cardiac enzymes\n   - Repeat EKG now\n   - Patient already received levofloxacin for pneumonia in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**]\n   discuss further broadening coverage, however no fever, leukocytosis, or\n   sputum production (though she is on steroids chronically)\n   - Follow up blood, sputum cultures\n   - Nebulizer treatments if helpful (though will avoid albuterol until\n   stable heart rate for a few more hours)\n   - Checking BNP given history of orthopnea, however suspect this was\n   more likely due to AF with RVR, could also consider diuresis once more\n   stable\n   - Consider repeat transthoracic echocardiogram should her hypoxia and\n   dyspnea not improve with above measures\n   .\n   #) Hypotension: Differential includes secondary to poor forward flow\n   from rapid ventricular response to AF, sepsis from infection, adrenal\n   insufficiency, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose, and\n   poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Other less likely possibilities\n   include cardiac event, pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT\n   (though no pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).\n   - IVF resuscitation until lactate normalizes, following urine output\n   - Checking random cortisol, consider initiation stress dose steroids\n   given chronic steroid use and recent taper from higher doses\n   - Consider expansion of antibiotic coverage, however currently does not\n   appear septic\n   - Continue PO amiodarone to improve HR control\n   - Cycle cardiac enzymes, though suspect she may have bump in troponin\n   given demand of RVR\n   - Sending urine, blood cultures, sputum if able (although already\n   received antibiotics in ED prior to any cultures being obtained)\n   .\n   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has\n   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone. She\n   reported not taking her amiodarone or metoprolol in the setting of not\n   feeling well for the last two days. Currently her rate is appropriately\n   controlled after receiving amiodarone bolus and PO home dose.\n   - Continue home amiodarone, holding metoprolol given hypotension, will\n   re-start later if BP stable\n   - Patient is not currently anticoagulated. She reports she had a 12\n   unit GIB in the past due to diverticulosis, so anti-coagulation has\n   been held since that time.\n   .\n   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.\n   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without\n   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be\n   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib\n   fracture seen on CXR.\n   - Hydromorphone at home dose, follow up cardiac enzymes.\n   .\n   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]\n   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on\n   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded\n   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with\n   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further\n   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note\n   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line\n   chemotherapy.\n   - Will alert oncology of patient's admission, appreciate any\n   recommendations or assistance with management.\n   - Will likely involve IP and consider bronchoscopy and palliative\n   stenting, if appropriate, to help with possible post-obstructive\n   pneumonia\n   .\n   #) Anemia: Patient's anemia appears to be at her baseline (last HCT of\n   35.2 appears to be abherration from others in system which are 24-27).\n   Should she have symptoms of ischemia, would consider transfusion to\n   assist with volume repletion.\n   - Send type and cross, consider transfusion should she continue to need\n   volume and/or become symptomatic.\n   .\n   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last\n   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than\n   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.\n   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications\n   .\n   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Continue steroid therapy (just completed\n   taper down to home dose of 10 mg prednisone daily), however suspect she\n   would benefit from stress dosing for her acute illness, given that she\n   had been on higher doses with her history of being on steroids for her\n   cerebral edema on a longer term basis.\n   - Continue 10 mg prednisone\n   .\n   #) Coronary artery disease: EKG\n   - Will cycle enzymes\n   - Continue home aspirin, holding home BP medications ([**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan)\n   given hypotension, has allergy to statins.\n   - Repeat EKG\n   .\n   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.\n   .\n   #) FEN: Once respiratory status more stable, cardiac diet.

This timing narrows differential to\n   aggressive inflammatory lung malignancy, PCP (in setting of elevated\n   LDH) or amiodarone pulmonary toxicity.

For now continue amio and start high dose PO\n   steroids, up from current dose of 10mg for PMR\n   - will consult cardiology regarding other potential afib therapy given\n   previous difficulty with rate control.\n   - Although very low likelihood of infectious etiology, will f/u\n   cultures, continue levoflox.\n   - COPD exacerbation unlikely so nebs not necessary. Will be getting PO\n   steroids anyway.\n   - Goal sats 90-94%.\n   - Will hold off diuresis today as congestion will likely improve with\n   or without diuresis with improved HR.\n   - Will check TTE today for new WMA, valvular defects or strain.\n   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.\n   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow\n   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,\n   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Unlikely contribution of\n   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency\n as afebrile, no\n   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.\n   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG\n   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no\n   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).\n   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume\n   - Does not need stress dose steroids but will be getting increased dose\n   for ? amiodarone toxicity\n   - Does not appear to be septic\n   - Continue PO amiodarone until confirm or rule out toxicity and\n   cardiology input re alternative rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].\n   - f/u pancultures\n   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has\n   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although\n   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.  Also\n   likely component of hypoxia inducing afib given worsening lung disease.\n   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, with short reversion to Afib rate\n   in 120s with other VSS.\n   - Continue home amiodarone\n   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control\n   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.\n   - cardiology consult re potential alternative therapy if amiodarone\n   toxicity confirmed.\n   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.\n   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without\n   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be\n   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib\n   fracture seen on CXR.\n   - Hydromorphone at home dose\n   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs.

She was last seen as an outpatient on\n   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded\n   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with\n   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further\n   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note\n   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line\n   chemotherapy.\n   - discuss long term plan with oncology\n   - palliative care and social work consults\n   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3\n   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and\n   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.\n   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)\n   - Type and cross active\n   - Consider slow transfusion (EF 50%, likely worse with tachycardia),\n   although not convinced that pt requires volume.\n   - Guaiac stools\n   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last\n   months appears to be 1.1-1.2.

I agree with the\n   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and\n   add the following points:\n   Mrs [**Known lastname 8556**] has had progressive decline in her breathing with\n   worsening O2 needs and now development of Afib/ RVR in setting of\n   hypoxemia. She denies cough or hemoptyis or chest pain either.\n   Exam notable for elderly WF with Tm of 99 BP of 110/70 HR of 60 to 110\n   ( NSR or afib) RRof 24  with sats of 97% on NRB FM . She has end\n   inspiratory crackels in all lung fields and no evidence for wheeze. She\n   does not have peripheral edema.\n   Labs notable for WBC4.4  K, HCT 23.0 , K+ 4.0 , Cr  0.9, lactate. 1.5 (\n   2.7) , LDH is 335, cortisol is 42. CXR with diffuse ASD ( reticular and\n   alveolar infiltrates in Lingula, RUL, RML, RLL), CT shows diffuse\n   infiltrates in all lung fields with traction bronchiectasis, minimal\n   effusions, enlarging lung nodules (? mets) and some GGO in subsegments\n   too. PA size has increased and c/w CXR of [**9-29**], changes have rapidly\n   worsened. EKG is without ischemic change.\n   I am concerned regarding possible interstial PNA ( ? PCP vs atypical\n   infection vs amiodarone pulmonary toxicity) in addition to advancing\n   tumor burden ( increasing nodules and ? lymphangitis)..We will attempt\n   sputum induction today but may need intubation for Bronchoscopy / BAL\n   to r/o infectious etiology. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]  ( follows patient closely) will\n   be consulted regarding this but repeat echo to assess pulmonary\n   pressures will be done in next 24 hrs. For the short term higher dose\n   steroids will be started today and coverage continued for CAP (\n   atypical). if she cannot sustain NSR, we will request cardiology\n   colleagues to advise regarding alternative agents for rhythm control.\n   Remainder of plan as outlined above.\n   Patient is critically ill\n   Total time: 50 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]\n   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) 1973**],  MD\n   Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine\n   [**Hospital1 1015**]\n   [**Location (un) 7530**], KS-B23\n   [**Location (un) 223**], MA 02215Sleep Medicine\n   [**Hospital1 1015**]\n   [**Location (un) 7530**], KS-B23\n   [**Location (un) 223**], [**Numeric Identifier 4370**]\n   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Name8 (MD) 1973**], MD\n   on:[**2143-2-17**] 01:49 PM ------\n", "timestamp": 5463438780}, {"charttime": "2143-02-18 06:38:00", "subject_id": 222, "hadm_id": 103002.0, "category": "Nursing", "text": "Atrial fibrillation (Afib)\n   Assessment:\n   Pt has remained in sr to sb during shift\n   Action:\n   Pt startedon lopressor tid 12.5 mg, amiodarone dc\n   Response:\n   Pt\ns hr decreased for 60\ns to 50\ns since dosing\n   Plan:\n   Cont to monitor hr, ?

CT also demonstrated multi-focal\n   pneumonia, though she has had little clinical symptoms to suggest this;\n   a post-obstructive pneumonia is certainly possible as well, which could\n   remain more clinically asymptomatic. Her worsening underlying lung\n   malignancy also could account for some degree of her dyspnea, but would\n   not expect this to be so acute unless she had collapse or plugging. A\n   primary cardiac event is also possible. PE in setting of malignancy is\n   a possibility, but ruled out by CTA. CXR negative for pneumothorax.\n   Heart failure is also a possibility, however she does not have any\n   significant edema.\n   - Trend lactate, VBG\n   - Cycle cardiac enzymes\n   - Repeat EKG now\n   - Patient already received levofloxacin for pneumonia in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**]\n   discuss further broadening coverage.\n   - Follow up blood, sputum cultures\n   - Nebulizer treatments if helpful (though will avoid albuterol until\n   stable heart rate for a few more hours)\n   - Checking BNP given history of orthopnea, however suspect this was\n   more likely due to AF with RVR\n   - Consider repeat transthoracic echocardiogram should her hypoxia and\n   dyspnea not improve with above measures\n   .\n   #) Hypotension: Differential includes secondary to poor forward flow\n   from rapid ventricular response to AF, sepsis from infection, adrenal\n   insufficiency, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose, and\n   poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Other less likely possibilities\n   include cardiac event, pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT\n   (though no pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).\n   - IVF resuscitation until lactate normalizes, following urine output\n   - Checking random cortisol, initiating stress dose steroids given\n   chronic steroid use and recent taper from higher doses\n   - Expand antibiotic coverage\n   - Continue PO amiodarone to improve HR control\n   - Cycle cardiac enzymes, though suspect she may have bump in troponin\n   given demand of RVR\n   - Sending urine, blood cultures, sputum if able (although already\n   received antibiotics in ED prior to any cultures being obtained)\n   .\n   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has\n   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone. She\n   reported not taking her amiodarone or metoprolol in the setting of not\n   feeling well for the last two days. Currently her rate is appropriately\n   controlled after receiving amiodarone bolus and PO home dose.\n   - Continue home amiodarone, holding metoprolol given hypotension\n   - Patient is not currently anticoagulated.

It is unclear if there will be further\n   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note\n   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line\n   chemotherapy.\n   - Will alert oncology of patient's admission, appreciate any\n   recommendations or assistance with management.\n   .\n   #) Anemia: Patient's anemia appears to be at her baseline (last HCT of\n   35.2 appears to be abherration from others in system which are 24-27).\n   Should she have symptoms of ischemia, would consider transfusion to\n   assist with volume repletion.\n   - Send type and cross, consider transfusion should she continue to need\n   volume and/or become symptomatic.\n   .\n   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last\n   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than\n   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.\n   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications\n   .\n   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Continue steroid therapy (just completed\n   taper down to home dose of 10 mg prednisone daily), however suspect she\n   would benefit from stress dosing for her acute illness, given that she\n   had been on higher doses with her history of being on steroids for her\n   cerebral edema on a longer term basis.\n   - Stress dose steroids\n   .\n   #) Coronary artery disease: EKG\n   - Will cycle enzymes\n   - Continue home aspirin, holding home BP medications ([**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan)\n   given hypotension, has allergy to statins.\n   - Repeat EKG\n   .\n   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.\n   .\n   #) FEN: Once respiratory status more stable, cardiac diet.

CT also demonstrated multi-focal\n   pneumonia, though she has had little clinical symptoms to suggest this;\n   a post-obstructive pneumonia is certainly possible as well, which could\n   remain more clinically asymptomatic. Her worsening underlying lung\n   malignancy also could account for some degree of her dyspnea, but would\n   not expect this to be so acute unless she had collapse or plugging. A\n   primary cardiac event is also possible. PE in setting of malignancy is\n   a possibility, but ruled out by CTA. CXR negative for pneumothorax.\n   Heart failure is also a possibility, however she does not have any\n   significant edema.\n   - Trend lactate, VBG\n   - Cycle cardiac enzymes\n   - Repeat EKG now\n   - Patient already received levofloxacin for pneumonia in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**]\n   discuss further broadening coverage.\n   - Follow up blood, sputum cultures\n   - Nebulizer treatments if helpful (though will avoid albuterol until\n   stable heart rate for a few more hours)\n   - Checking BNP given history of orthopnea, however suspect this was\n   more likely due to AF with RVR\n   - Consider repeat transthoracic echocardiogram should her hypoxia and\n   dyspnea not improve with above measures\n   .\n   #) Hypotension: Differential includes secondary to poor forward flow\n   from rapid ventricular response to AF, sepsis from infection, adrenal\n   insufficiency, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose, and\n   poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Other less likely possibilities\n   include cardiac event, pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT\n   (though no pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).\n   - IVF resuscitation until lactate normalizes, following urine output\n   - Checking random cortisol, initiating stress dose steroids given\n   chronic steroid use and recent taper from higher doses\n   - Expand antibiotic coverage\n   - Continue PO amiodarone to improve HR control\n   - Cycle cardiac enzymes, though suspect she may have bump in troponin\n   given demand of RVR\n   - Sending urine, blood cultures, sputum if able (although already\n   received antibiotics in ED prior to any cultures being obtained)\n   .\n   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has\n   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone. She\n   reported not taking her amiodarone or metoprolol in the setting of not\n   feeling well for the last two days. Currently her rate is appropriately\n   controlled after receiving amiodarone bolus and PO home dose.\n   - Continue home amiodarone, holding metoprolol given hypotension\n   - Patient is not currently anticoagulated. She reports she had a 12\n   unit GIB in the past due to diverticulosis, so anti-coagulation has\n   been held since that time.\n   .\n   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]\n   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on\n   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded\n   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with\n   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further\n   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note\n   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line\n   chemotherapy.\n   - Will alert oncology of patient's admission, appreciate any\n   recommendations or assistance with management.\n   .\n   #) Anemia: Patient's anemia appears to be at her baseline (last HCT of\n   35.2 appears to be abherration from others in system which are 24-27).\n   Should she have symptoms of ischemia, would consider transfusion to\n   assist with volume repletion.\n   - Send type and cross, consider transfusion should she continue to need\n   volume and/or become symptomatic.\n   .\n   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last\n   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than\n   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.\n   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications\n   .\n   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Continue steroid therapy (just completed\n   taper down to home dose of 10 mg prednisone daily), however suspect she\n   would benefit from stress dosing for her acute illness, given that she\n   had been on higher doses with her history of being on steroids for her\n   cerebral edema on a longer term basis.\n   - Stress dose steroids\n   .\n   #) Coronary artery disease: EKG\n   - Will cycle enzymes\n   - Continue home aspirin, holding home BP medications ([**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan)\n   given hypotension, has allergy to statins.\n   - Repeat EKG\n   .\n   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.\n   .\n   #) FEN: Once respiratory status more stable, cardiac diet.
